Introductions- 
I was not hear last week. Can anyone here give me a quick summary of the main points from last week? I looked at the lectures, but maybe you can help me understand where you are coming from. It is a small group so I hope that we can discuss these topics. I do not want to just plow through the material and have you figure it out on your own. I will be teaching you through some modeling exercises on Thursday that will go along with the paper. We will also be working with a specialized piece of equipment to measure photosynthesis. I plan on heading outside and showing you how to use the instrument on some real plants. Today will be lecture material and discussion. Thursday we will do some more hands on things. 

Photosynthesis is awesome because it means that plants eat light! It is how plants get along in this crazy messed up world. Today we are going to be talking about the two major photosynthetic functional types for crops and research. I am going to start by providing some context for why environmental responses are important for understanding how we are going to feed ourselves as a species in this century. Photosynthesis is such an important process that we have really good models to help us understand the complexities of plant response to the environment. Last quarter you learned about the details of chloroplast biology. Can anyone give me a summary of some of the most interesting aspects of that class? Learned about the detailed biochemistry of the reactions, chloroplast development, etc. Today we are going to be scaling between the detailed molecular genetics work to find out genetic underpinning and what is going on in the leaf as a whole, right now, all around this campus!. I am really like teaching through models because they can account for so many things and see where our intuition might fail us. Your reading assignment is a paper that summarizes many other other mathematical models of photosynthesis. I purposefully picked a harder paper for discussion because I want to show you that it is not that hard once you learn all the individual components. The harder part, and where the research questions are, is in putting all the pieces together. 

#Tuesday Outline
###How does photosynthesis fit into this course?
Learned last week about light detection and circadian regulation.
Details of chloroplast biology.
Will learn about water stress, transport, etc. 
Photosynthesis is so important it is likely to be involved directly or indirectly to your thesis project

###Climate change Context
-We are using fossil fuels and pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
-We are changing the composition of the atmosphere and that impacts the global carbon cycle.
-These atmospheric composition changes are altering global temperatures and precipitation patterns. 

###Why models?
-Combine many concepts into compact expressions
-These models work at the leaf level, and are the basis for scaling. 

###Simple Photosynthesis Model
-We are going to build this up from biophysical principles. It is the biophysics that allows us to model these processes and also to design instruments to measure these processes. We are going to brain storm on Thursday about how we might go about designing a piece of equipment to measure these processes. We are going to do this through the power of first principles. 

E.g. Ball-Berry Model
A = (Ca - Ci )/gs

###Complex Photosynthesis Model
-We are going to work up to this by the end of today.
