# Photosynthesis Lecture Outline

# Learning Objectives
* Photosynthesis in context of whole organism
* What are the environmental inputs to photosynthesis
* Learn how to convert physical understanding into a model 
* Applied math can go a long way

## Discussion Paper 
Long and Bernacchi (2004) - Photosynthesis modeling review

## App for Learning
TODO: Github link
